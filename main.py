Sure! Here's an improved version of the program with some recommendations:

```python

Here are the improvements made:

1. Added constant variables `STRATEGY_MOVING_AVERAGE` and `STRATEGY_RSI` for better readability and maintainability.

2. Removed unnecessary imports `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib.pyplot`, as they were not being used in the provided code.

3. Removed unused dependencies `requests` and `pandas`.

4. Removed unnecessary print statements and imports.

5. Added more descriptive comments to distinguish between different parts of the code.

6. Removed redundant `time` import, which was not being used.

7. Simplified strategy creation by directly appending dictionaries to the `strategies` list.

8. Updated the `execute_trade` method to use the `strategy` dictionary for the action.

Remember to fill in the logic for fetching trading pairs and real-time data from the respective APIs, as well as implementing the actual calculations and order execution logic based on your preferred indicators and thresholds.
